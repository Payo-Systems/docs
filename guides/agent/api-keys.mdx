## Overview

Agent API keys (tokens) authenticate your agent when calling paid MCP tools. Each key has scope `agent:connect` which allows connecting to MCP servers and being charged for tool calls.

## Creating Keys

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to API Keys">
    Navigate to **API Keys** in your dashboard sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Create Key">
    Click the **Create Key** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name your key">
    Give it a descriptive name like "Production", "Development", or "Claude Desktop".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy immediately">
    The full key is shown **once**. Copy it and store it securely.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
You cannot retrieve a key after creation. If you lose it, create a new one and delete the old one.
</Warning>

## Key Format

Agent keys follow this format:

```
sk_live_a1b2c3d4e5f6...
```

- `sk_` - Secret key prefix
- `live_` - Production environment
- `a1b2...` - 64 random hex characters

The dashboard shows only the prefix and last 4 characters for identification:

```
sk_live_...x7z9
```

## Multiple Keys

Create separate keys for different purposes:

| Key Name | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| `Production` | Your deployed agent |
| `Development` | Local testing |
| `Claude Desktop` | Personal use |
| `Cursor` | IDE integration |

Each key shares your account balance but can be revoked independently.

## Rotating Keys

To rotate a key:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a new key">
    Create a new key with the same name (add "v2" or date).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update your agents">
    Update your agent configurations to use the new key.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delete the old key">
    Once all agents are updated, delete the old key.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Deleting a key is immediate and permanent. Any agents still using it will receive `TOKEN_INVALID` errors.
</Note>

## Deleting Keys

To delete a key:

1. Go to **API Keys**
2. Find the key you want to delete
3. Click the **Delete** button (trash icon)
4. Confirm deletion

Deleted keys cannot be recovered.

## Troubleshooting

### "TOKEN_INVALID" Error

Your key may be:
- Deleted from the dashboard
- Incorrectly copied (missing characters)
- From a different account

**Fix**: Create a new key and update your configuration.

### "TOKEN_MISSING" Error

The MCP server didn't receive your token. Check:
- `AGENT_TOKEN` environment variable is set
- HTTP `Authorization` header is being sent
- No typos in your configuration

See [Configuring Your Agent](/guides/agent/configuration) for setup help.
