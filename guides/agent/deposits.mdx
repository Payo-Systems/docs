## Overview

Your **credits balance** is the pool of funds your agents can spend on paid MCP tools. When a tool is called, its price is deducted from your balance.

## Viewing Your Balance

Go to **Wallet** in your dashboard to see:

- **Current balance** - Available credits in USD
- **Recent transactions** - Charges and deposits
- **Spending trends** - Usage over time

## Understanding Charges

Each tool call deducts its price from your balance:

| Tool | Price | 100 calls |
|------|-------|-----------|
| `get_weather` | $0.01 | $1.00 |
| `analyze_image` | $0.05 | $5.00 |
| `generate_report` | $0.10 | $10.00 |

Free tools (price = $0) don't affect your balance.

## Transaction History

Your wallet shows all transactions:

```
-$0.05  get_forecast        WeatherAPI    2 min ago
-$0.01  get_weather         WeatherAPI    5 min ago
-$0.02  analyze_sentiment   TextAPI       1 hour ago
+$50.00 Deposit             -             Yesterday
```

Each entry includes:
- **Amount** - Positive for deposits, negative for charges
- **Tool/Type** - What the charge was for
- **Provider** - Who received the payment
- **Time** - When it occurred

## Low Balance Warnings

When your balance drops below $1.00, you'll see a warning in your dashboard.

If your balance reaches $0, tool calls will fail with `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE`.

<Tip>
Set up a reminder to check your balance weekly, or deposit larger amounts less frequently.
</Tip>

## Budgeting

To estimate monthly costs:

1. **Identify tools you use** - List the MCP tools your agent calls
2. **Check their prices** - Ask the provider or check their docs
3. **Estimate call volume** - How many calls per day/week?
4. **Calculate**: `calls × price = cost`

**Example:**
- 1,000 weather calls/day × $0.01 = $10/day = $300/month
- 100 analysis calls/day × $0.05 = $5/day = $150/month
- **Total**: ~$450/month
